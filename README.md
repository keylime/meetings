# Keylime Meetings

## When and where?

The keylime project meets every Wednesday @ 15:30 UTC to 16:00. 

Anyone is welcome to join the meeting.

The meeting is hosted in [gitter chat](https://gitter.im/keylime-project/community)

## Agendas and Minutes

All meeting agendas are created as [github issues](https://github.com/keylime/meetings/issues), using an [github issue template](https://github.com/keylime/meetings/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/meeting-template.md).

The current pinned open issue is the agenda for the next meeting due to take place. Closed issues are for 
previous meetings that are now archived.

## Why github issues?

Using github issues allows other to comment on an agenda and so encourages participation. Previous agendas 
can be easily linked to and as issues are closed they are also indexed, thereby making them easily searchable
amd allowing a previous discussion / outcome / action to be referenced in later discussions.
