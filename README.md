# Keylime Meetings

## When and where?

The Keylime community meets every 4th Wednesday of the month, from 16:00 to 17:00 UK time ([GMT](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/gmt)/[BST](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/bst)). 

Anyone is welcome to join the meeting. We discuss recent work, notable news and anything else that comes up.

Meetings are generally held in video form. More information, including the date of the next video meeting as well as any agenda items, can be found in the respective [issues](https://github.com/keylime/meetings/labels/video-meeting).

The meeting is also normally announced on the CNCF's Slack Instance, in the [#keylime channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01ARE2QUTZ)

## Agendas and Minutes

All meeting agendas are created as [github issues](https://github.com/keylime/meetings/issues), using an [github issue template](https://github.com/keylime/meetings/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/meeting-template.md).

The current pinned open issue is the agenda for the next meeting due to take place. Closed issues are for
previous meetings that are now archived.

## Why github issues?

Using github issues allows other to comment on an agenda and so encourages participation. Previous agendas
can be easily linked to and as issues are closed they are also indexed, thereby making them easily searchable
amd allowing a previous discussion / outcome / action to be referenced in later discussions.
